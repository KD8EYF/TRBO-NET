# Master radio configuration. Currently not used for anything, but the
# ARS and TMS radio IDs are set in CPS for client radios.

# CAI network settings, must match what you have configured in CPS
# (all radios on channel must have same settings!)
cai_network:		12
cai_group_network:	225

# these must match radio configuration, too:
# Automatic Registration Service UDP Port, configured in CPS
ars_port:		4005
# Text Messaging Service UDP Port, configured in CPS
tms_port:		4007
# The GPS location port is actually not configurable in CPS.
loc_port:		4001

# timers, set in seconds:
# ARS timeout: when to consider station as being away from network
# (radio sends "hello" every 30 minutes to reset this timer)
ars_timeout:		1900
# how often to 'ping' station if it has not been heard lately
# (disabling is good idea, reduce network traffic and channel busy)
ars_ping_interval:	900
# GPS location request interval, set to 0 if you not want receive
# GPS data from radios
gps_req_interval:	300

# some thought on above:
#
# ars_ping_interval should be larger than gps_req_interval,
# so unnecessary pings can be avoid thanks to incoming positions.
#
# ars_timeout should probably be ars_ping_interval*2 and then some.
#
# it's probably no good to set these to very low values, since they can
# keep channel busy (PTT down on radio says "Channel busy" if data
# traffic is ongoing and user is then annoyed). Better go up from
# these values than down.
#

# messaging settings:
# How old messages (in seconds) are dropped from Tx queue.

# The callsign will be used for status display and APRS gateway
